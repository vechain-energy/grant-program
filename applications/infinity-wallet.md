### Overview
Infinity Wallet is a decentralized all-in-one non-custodial wallet ecosystem and Web3 browser, that provides a one-stop solution for all a user's decentralized needs (a Wallet and Web3 browser Super App). As not a browser extension, but a standalone application, enabling seamless onboarding and easy access and use of crypto, cross-border payments, DeFi, NFTs and Web3. All within a single unique platform on desktop since our launch in 2020, supporting around 48,000 MAU (with mobile version to launch later this year that aims to redefine the entire mobile experience).

Through the Infinity Wallet we are opening up ease of access to the decentralized world for both less technical users and existing users in the space. Removing some of the barriers that exist today, to provide a more enhanced and curated in-wallet user experience, with a flawless user interface as a one-stop hub. To make it as easy as possible for everyone to onboard into the decentralized space and Web3, as it is with the Web2 space today.


### Project Details
The goal of the proposal would be to enhance Vechain with a much needed one-stop user focused wallet, providing Vechain access to the many advancements we have, bringing much needed valuable infrastructure, services and ecosystem support, which Vechain currently lacks. While enhancing the user experience and bringing new utility, and allowing for easier usage, access and adoption of Vechain and its ecosystem by less tech-savvy users.

Infinity Wallet will allow Vechain and its ecosystem to be more easily adopted and used by the general public, in a unique crypto wallet, payment solution and Web3 browser built for the masses, and used already by hundreds of thousands of users worldwide for easy cross-border payments, access to DeFi, NFTs and interacting with Web3/DApps directly within their wallet. As a one-stop platform delivering a much needed enhanced user experience and access to all a users needs, making adoption of the Vechain ecosystem as easy and intuitive as possible and boosting awareness, usage and utility.

Below are some of the key infrastructure and features/services that could benefit and bring value to Vechain and its ecosystem:

### Ecosystem Fit
Wallets are the core component required for any chain, enabling users to interact and onboard to Vechain, and access the Vechain ecosystem (Payments, DApps, DeFi, Web3, NFTs, Decentralized Identity and much more). Making wallets the defining factor for usage and adoption of a chain and its entire ecosystem, however as of today wallets are one of the least well developed applications in the crypto ecosystem.

Today, wallets act mainly as an interface, serving primarily as a transaction signing layer, with very limited functionality or in-wallet features, requiring use of multiple platforms, and are generally lacking in basic UX, while providing very unprofessional, hard to use and aesthetically poor user interfaces, with most platforms built with a focus on developers rather than end users. This has been sufficient for the early adopters in crypto, however, for the next billion users to onboard, a more curated, frictionless and high quality user experience is required!

As of today the Vechain ecosystem has very few wallet solutions and no desktop wallet one-stop super app! The wallet solutions that do exist today are not really built for mass adoption or use by less tech savvy users, they are more built with a focus on usage by the existing tech-savvy user base and generally provide low quality user interfaces, lack a curated in-wallet experience, lack many features/services that users require and overall provide a terrible UX.

Infinity Wallet steps in to fill this need, as a one-stop hub for all payment, DeFi, NFT and Web3 activity. Providing a unique all-in-one wallet and first of its kind Web3 browser solution with a full spectrum of in-platform services, features and protocols, focusing on delivering a premium platform and enhancing the user experience, while providing a user centric interface for a seamless decentralized user experience and new wallet options. Streamlining accessibility and lowering the barrier to entry, to allow for easy onboarding and adoption of DeFi, crypto payments & Web3.


## Team 
Our team is made up from individuals that have extensive experience in the space, with a complete crypto experience from Smart Contracts, DeFi/Web3 projects, DApp development, Wallet and more. Our team has a general background in software development and UI/UX.

Additionally, our team members have between 5-10 years of experience within the space (as investors, miners and developers), so we have a vast amount of experience and understanding of major shortcomings in the market, along with what is needed to enable mass adoption.

#### Usage of funds
The grant would be utilized to help fund the developments outlined for building out Vechain with complete integration into the Infinity Wallet, its features and required infrastructure that will be developed. As we operate as a free to use platform for hundreds of thousands of users and are self funded, we require a grant to help cover the inital integration development costs. While this would provide Vechain with a much needed valuable platform that is solving many issues in the crypto, Web3 and payments space. All on-going costs will be covered by us and are not included in the grant amount.


#### Community engagement
We will create a video tutorial on the integration of Vechain within the Infinity Wallet, along with how to access and use Vechain to take advantage of all the benfits of using and acccessing Vechain and its ecosystem within the Infinity Wallet.


## Future Plans
Our long term plan is to continue to refine and deliver innovative solutions with the Infinity Wallet. Working closely with users to further establish Infinity Wallet as a leading wallet and DeFi ecosystem with Web3 browser, serving hundreds of millions of users on Desktop and Mobile.

We have a lot planned over the next couple of years, however some of the developments planned over the next 6 months that could benefit Vechain in the future as we release them on a case by case basis include:
* UX focused Mobile Wallet release (redefining the entire DeFi & Web3 experience, from UI, UX and features);
* Social Wallet (removing the need for a seed phrase and enabling users to create a wallet via social login, allowing for easier onboarding and usage of DeFi & Web3 by the general Web2 user required for mass adoption);

More on our overall roadmap that could benefit Vechain can be found on page 27, here: https://infinitywallet.io/docs/Infinity%20Wallet%20Deck.pdf OR our docs here https://docs.infinitywallet.io/infinity-wallet/infinity-ecosystem-roadmap

Specific to Vechain we will continue to provide ongoing support, as well as expand Vechain support into our unique user focused mobile release which is expected early 2024.


## Additional Information 

**How did we hear about the Grants Program?** 
Our support team has received requests from users reaching out regarding expanding support/developing out Vechain, which is why we looked to see if there was a grants program to support this.
